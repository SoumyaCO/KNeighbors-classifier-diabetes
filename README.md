# Predicting Diabetes using KNeighborsClassifier.
![accuracy vs n_neighbors graph](https://github.com/SoumyaCO/KNeighbors-classifier-diabetes/blob/main/knn-image.png)
### 1. 🎯 Aim: 
Train a model with the diabetes data to predict a patient has diabetes or not.
### 2. 📚 Concepts Covered:
* Data Manupulation
* Feature Engineering
* Scaling a dataset
* Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
* `confusion_matix`
* F1_score, precision
* Data Visualization

### 3. 🔎 Approach: 
> * Importing the data
> * Understanding the features
> * Cleaning the data
> * Scale and Impute the data
> * Instantiate a `KNeighborsClassifier()` model from `sklearn.neighbors`
> * To have the right number of `n_neighbors` performed `GridSearchCV`
> * After getting the `grid.best_params_` visualized `confusion_matrix`
> * Calculated Precision, Recall, F1_score
> * Lastly visualized a accuracy vs n_neighbors plot

👉 In the notebook I've provided detailed codes and concepts. If you like it please give a star ⭐️

❗If you are trying it in **google colab** you have to upload the dataset [dibetes.csv]
